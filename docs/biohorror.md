# Bio-Horror Faction File

## Overview
**The Bio-Horror** is not a faction in the traditional sense, but rather a virulent, evolving bioweapon unleashed upon the Jovian system. Originating from a failed Megacorp experiment, this sentient, parasitic lifeform consumes and corrupts all organic and synthetic matter, growing stronger with each assimilation. It spreads through spores, direct contact, and the conversion of its victims into grotesque thralls. Its ultimate goal is unknown, but its relentless expansion threatens to engulf all life in the system.

They are a force of primal, biological terror, antithetical to the ordered societies of the Republic and the profit-driven Megacorps. The Jovian Sisters, with their advanced biology, view the Bio-Horror with a mixture of dread and morbid fascination, seeing a twisted reflection of unchecked evolution.

*   **Archetype:** Swarm / Self-Destruct / Corruption
*   **Motto:** "Assimilate. Evolve. Consume."
*   **Visual Style:** **Gore-Punk / Alien Organics.** Pulsating fleshy masses, chitinous plating, glowing fungal growths, dripping viscera, exposed bone and muscle. Units are often asymmetrical, unsettling, and rapidly mutating. Think grotesque, visceral, and constantly changing.

## The Forms of the Horror

### 1. The Spore-Mind (The Hive)
The collective consciousness of the Bio-Horror, coordinating its spread and assimilation. Not a physical entity, but a guiding intelligence.
*   **Specialty:** Spawning units, spreading corruption, mutating existing forms.

### 2. The Thralls (The Flesh)
Victims assimilated by the Bio-Horror, their bodies twisted into combat forms. Often expendable and numerous.
*   **Specialty:** Swarm tactics, self-sacrifice for greater effects, rapid reproduction.

### 3. The Apex Forms (The Maw)
Highly evolved, specialized horrors that manifest when enough biomass has been assimilated. Powerful and resilient, representing the peak of biological warfare.
*   **Specialty:** High damage, disruptive abilities, powerful death effects.

## Strategic Doctrine
The Bio-Horror playstyle is characterized by **overwhelming numbers**, **unpredictable mutations**, and the **strategic sacrifice** of its own units to fuel its growth. They are a relentless, ever-advancing tide.

### Core Pillars:
1.  **Mass Production:** Spawning numerous cheap units to overwhelm the enemy board and soak up damage.
2.  **Sacrifice & Growth:** Destroying friendly units (often Thralls) to trigger powerful effects, buff other units, or generate resources.
3.  **Corruption:** Debuffing and weakening enemy units, making them easier to assimilate or destroy.
4.  **Evolution:** Units often mutate or transform into stronger forms after surviving damage or performing certain actions.

### Strengths:
*   Incredibly resilient to single-target removal due to sheer numbers.
*   Powerful synergistic effects when units are sacrificed.
*   Strong board presence and snowball potential.
*   Ability to rapidly recover from board clears.

### Weaknesses:
*   Individual units are often weak and vulnerable.
*   Can be vulnerable to early game control if they can't establish a foothold.
*   Reliance on death triggers can be countered by silence or exile effects.
*   Can quickly run out of resources if sacrifices aren't managed carefully.
