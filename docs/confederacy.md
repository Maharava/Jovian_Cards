# The Outer Confederacy

## Overview
**The Outer Confederacy** is a loose alliance of independent settlements, moons, and stations beyond the Asteroid Belt. Born from necessity and forged in the vacuum of the Outer System, they represent humanity's frontier spirit: rugged, independent, and unwilling to bow to the distant bureaucracy of Earth.

They are the newest "faction" on the galactic stage. To the Republic, they are a legal headache; to the Megacorps, they are a market to be exploited; to the Jovian Sisters, they are home.

*   **Archetype:** Guerilla / Combo / Synergy
*   **Motto:** "Free Sky, Free Void."
*   **Visual Style:** **Space Western / Industrial.** Worn metal, repurposed mining equipment, jury-rigged starships, magnetic boots, and heavy kinetic weaponry. Not pretty, but it works.

## Origins
The Confederacy did not start as a nation. It began as a trade union of mining colonies on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn who were tired of the Republic's taxes and the Megacorps' predatory contracts.
*   **The Catalyst:** The "Europa Incident" and the persecution of the Jovian Sisters. When the Republic demanded the surrender of the "mutants," the Outer Worlds refused. This act of defiance solidified their alliance.
*   **Independence:** They consider themselves a sovereign state. The Republic is still debating what they are.

## Structure
Unlike the Republic's rigid hierarchy, the Confederacy is a decentralized democracy.
*   **The Council of Captains:** Decisions are made by a council of station administrators, ship captains, and settlement leaders. It is chaotic, loud, and often deadlock-prone, but it moves faster than the Republic.
*   **The Militia:** There is no standing "Army." Every ship is a warship; every miner is a militiaman. When the call goes out, the "Fleet" assembles from a thousand different vectors.

## Relationship with the Jovian Sisters
The Confederacy provides asylum to the Sisters. In exchange, the Sisters provide:
1.  **Technology:** Advanced tech from Jupiter's secret network (shields, medical tech, reactors).
2.  **Protection:** Sisters like **Ganymede** and **Amalthea** fight on the front lines, acting as force multipliers for the militia.

## Strategic Doctrine
The Confederacy cannot win a straight fight against the Republic Navy or a full Megacorp fleet. They rely on **Guerilla Warfare**.
*   **Hit and Run:** Strike fast, do damage, and fade into the asteroid fields.
*   **Scavenging:** Repurposing enemy tech and debris.
*   **Synergy:** Combined arms tactics where every unit supports the other.

## Key Locations
*   **Callisto:** The unofficial capital and trade hub. Home to massive refugee sectors and Adrastea's clinic.
*   **Titan (Saturn):** A major industrial center, constantly skirmishing with Ira Corp black sites.
*   **The Belt:** A lawless buffer zone filled with pirates, smugglers, and listening posts.
