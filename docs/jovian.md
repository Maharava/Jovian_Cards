# Jovian Sisters Faction File

## Overview
**The Jovian Sisters** (often called "The Family") are the genetically engineered children of **Jupiter**, the most brilliant geneticist to ever grace humanity. They are the first—and only—non-human sentient beings in the system. Though their baseline DNA is human, they were grown with radical genetic alterations that have matured into stable, functional post-human physiology—something regular humans can only approximate with crude surgery.

They are not a government. They are refugees, mercenaries, and celebrities living under the protection of the **Outer Confederacy**, a coalition of independent moon settlements. In exchange for asylum and privacy, the Sisters provide the Confederacy with advanced technology from Jupiter's network, allowing this young "Space Western" nation to stand toe-to-toe with the Republic.

While some Sisters work directly for the Confederacy military (like **Amalthea**) or local governments, most operate independently.

*   **Archetype:** Midrange / Synergy / Hero-Centric
*   **Motto:** "Evolution is our birthright."
*   **Visual Style:** **Bio-Punk.** Clean white medical aesthetics, bioluminescent blues and purples, organic curves, and high-tech visors. They stand in stark contrast to the rugged, industrial look of their Confederate allies.

## The "Sisters" (And Brothers)
The faction is led by the genetically engineered children of Jupiter. Each represents a unique facet of post-human evolution.

### 1. The Psychics (The Void-Touched)
Those who carry the active "Jupiter Gene," granting them varying degrees of telekinetic or telepathic power.
*   **Europa (The Eldest):** A powerful psychic burdened by leadership.
*   **Metis (The Empath):** Can heal wounds by manipulating biological energy but feels the pain of others.
*   **Lysithea (The Glitch):** A chaotic psychic whose presence disrupts technology.
*   **Cyllene (The Storm):** A raw, unrefined psychic force.

### 2. The Fighters (The Protectors)
Often "Psy-deaf" (immune to psychic influence), these siblings rely on physical prowess and advanced weaponry.
*   **Ganymede (The Pugilist):** A brawler who loves a fight.
*   **Himalia (The Shield):** A massive, heavily armored protector.
*   **Callisto (The Survivor):** A street-smart fighter who gets stronger as she takes damage.
*   **Thebe (The Apex):** A bio-hacked ranger and hunter.
*   **Taygete (The Heavy):** A master of suppression and heavy ordnance.

### 3. The Technicians (The Builders)
Those who interface with machines or enhance their bodies with cybernetics.
*   **Elara (The Scientist):** The researcher and strategist.
*   **Io (The Gremlin):** A drone operator and hacker.
*   **Carpo (The Specialist):** A pacifist gadgeteer who buffs her allies.

### 4. The Civilians (The Heart)
Those who try to live normal lives, providing support and resources.
*   **Kore (The Maiden):** A socialite who gathers information and resources.
*   **Adrastea (The Provider):** A dedicated healer who runs a charitable clinic.

## Strategic Doctrine
The Jovian playstyle focuses on **Unit Quality** and **Synergy**. Unlike the Megacorp swarm, Jovian units are individually strong and become significantly more powerful when working together.

### Core Pillars:
1.  **Synergy:** Many units buff allies (Support, Rally) or rely on board presence.
2.  **Sustain:** High access to **Healing** and **Shields** (Guard) allows units to survive multiple turns and accrue value.
3.  **Versatility:** Access to a wide toolkit—Stuns (Control), Rushes (Aggro), and Card Draw (Value).

### Strengths:
*   High-value units that are hard to remove.
*   Strong board control tools (Stun, Disarm).
*   Excellent card draw and resource generation.

### Weaknesses:
*   Units are expensive; tempo loss can be fatal.
*   Vulnerable to "hard removal" (destroy effects) since they invest heavily in single units.

## NOTES ON THE SISTERS
**Europa:** Psychic, quite powerful. Hears the Whispers, which worries her a lot. Ganymede, who she's closest to, always says she worries too much. Diplomatic and motherly, has a bit of friction with some sisters cos she tries to look after them. Not a matriarch. Concerned at 'what's coming'. Effectively immortal when she's summoned all her powers and is going all out - or at least, nobody has figured out how to kill her. Slow to anger and quite merciful.
**Ganymede:** A tease, a joker, with a potty mouth. Loves to fight but hates to kill, loves sport. Has quite a following in the Confederacy, especially of men - known to flash people at games. Easy to get along with, but if you cross a line she'll put you on the floor. Her muscles are stronger kg-for-kg - so though slender, she has more strength than a buffed body builder.
**Pasiphae (Pasi):** giggly, a bit shy, massive gamer girl and nerd. Mech pilot for the confederacy. Has a poor self-image (the devil horns she has doesn't help). Quite soft hearted, flies a medical and evacuation mech. Incredible reflexes.
**Io:** The tech gremlin, always building something. A femboy and tinkerer, Io has dropped out of university more times than he's counted. Refuses a stable job, but never short of funding - builds and mods drones for fun. He has a super-human knack for mechanical parts and robotics. Closest to Praxi, though they fight like cats and dogs. One of the youngest.
**Praxidike (Praxi):** a storm in a package, one of the youungest Jovians. Always up to mischief, and very pretty. Has cat ears but no cat tail - very good reflexes and and ability to read peoples emotions. Often pranking people, or flirting. Europa (and several other older sisters) despair she'll never grow up and do anything. She and Io have the most sibling-like relationship.
**Elara:** the most like mum, Elara is a scientist, though her focus is on biology. She's arguably the best florar biologist past the Belt, and a contender for top of her field across the system. She thinks at superhuman speeds and can get very frustrated with the antics of younger sisters. She's concerned by Europa's concerns, and has begun working with Thebe on genetic augmentations.
**Himalia:** Himalia just wants a normal life. Built like a tank, her muscles aren't quite as efficient as Gany's, but close - she's one of three sisters Gany will enevr fight in hand-to-hand, cos Himalia can take her out with one hit. Himalia works a normal job and dates, but is an absolute gym junkie - this is boosted by her hyper-efficient metabolism.
**Leda:** A thief who lives amongst the free states of the Jupiter and Saturn moons, Leda is thin, a recluse and quiet. She actively avoids her sisters - she's never forgiven their mother for 'abandoning' them. She walks quietly, can hold her breath for five minutes, and easily sees in the dark.
**Metis:** The only other outright Psychic, Metis hears the same Whispers as Europa, but only in her deepest nightmares. While Europa has a public image and works with the Confederacy, Metis strikes out on her own, wielding a high-tech cane to help channel her power, hunting for clues about the Whispers. She's one of the youngest Jovians, and extremely awkward around men. Unlike Europa, mercy isn't in Metis' nature - she'll eliminate a threat without a second thought.
**Amalthea:** A front line Confederate soldier, Amalthea lacks the hyper-efficient muscles of Himalia or Gany, but has boosted reflexes and heals about four times faster than a normal human. She loves her family, is loyal to the Confederacy, and the 'First in, Last out'. She's something of an embarressed mascot for the new Confederate Forces.
**Callisto:** Always a troublesome Jovian, she took to the streets, and is now a gang leader. A skilled brawler, nobody knows what, exactly, her Jovian abilities are, though Elara suspects she has a mild psychic persuasion effect with men. Callisto runs one of the largest crime rings on Encephalus, tolerated by the Confederacy only because she made a deal with Europa to keep Corp-backed crime out of the Confederacies third largest city. So far she's stuck to her deal. Sneering and stand offish, she has a soft spot for Praxi, Io, Carpo and Sinope.
**Carpo:** the other brother, femboy Carpo loves technology just like Io. But while his brother builds and mods drones, Carpo works on starships. A mechanic with an uncanny ability to spot defects and problems, Carpo works the trade lanes, loving life and exploring with the ships he works on. 
**Sinope:** The Evil Twin of Praxi, Sinope has cat ears and no tail as well. Just as teasing and playful, that's where the similarity ends with her otherwise-twin - Sinope is a manipulator. One of the youngest Jovians, she uses her looks and charm to get close to powerful men, then either drains them of their funds or screws them over another way. She has a bounty in a dozen settlements, but always escapes. Similar to Praxi, Sinope has an uncanny ability to read people.
**Thebe:** the wildest Jovian, Thebe explores the system, disappearing into the jungles of Mars for weeks or diving into fungal caves on Ceres. A bio-hacker, Thebe has made herself a futanari with elf ears, a stronger immune system and better metabolism. She takes jobs as a ranger, hunter and finder of rare things. Solidly loyal to her family, Thebe always shows up when needed.
**Adrastea:** "The Provider" to the locals of Callisto's refugee sectors. She runs a clinic that treats everyone, regardless of ability to pay. She possesses no psychic talent or cybernetics, but her hands are impossibly steady, and her ability to diagnose ailments by scent and touch borders on the supernatural. She is the moral compass that even Europa listens to.
**Kore:** A socialite who lives for the weekend. Kore works as a 'consultant' for high-end clubs on Ganymede, using her enhanced stamina and charm to be the life of every party. She knows everyone, hears everything, and is the family's best source of gossip and underground intel. She pretends to be shallow to hide how sharp she really is.
**Taygete:** A quiet professional who works the heavy loaders at the orbital docks. She found she had an affinity for heavy ordnance and kinetic suppression. She wears a modified industrial exo-suit into battle, wielding guns that would break a normal human's shoulder. She speaks softly but carries a very, very big gun.
