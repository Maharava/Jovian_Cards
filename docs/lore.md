# World of Jovian Cards: A Setting Guide

## The Solar System
The game takes place entirely within our Solar System. Humanity has colonized the inner planets, the Asteroid Belt, and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. There is **no Faster-Than-Light (FTL)** travel; travel between planets takes weeks or months, relying on efficient fusion drives and orbital mechanics.

This isolation has led to a fractured civilization. Earth and the Inner System are old, crowded, and bureaucratic. The Outer System (Jupiter, Saturn) is the frontier—dangerous, independent, and technologically divergent.

## Major Powers & Factions

### 1. The United Republic of Sol ("The Republic")
The colossal, ancient government of humanity, comprising 20+ billion citizens across Earth, Mars, Luna, Venus, and countless stations.
*   **Nature:** A sleeping giant paralyzed by its own fear of tyranny. It is "Mother Earth and Her Daughters," governed by endless committees.
*   **Power:** Technically unstoppable. It controls 90% of humanity's resources and almost all of humanity's military might , but its decision-making is so slow (decades-long) that other factions operate in its blind spots.
*   **Stance:** It is still debating whether the Jovians are human, aliens, or weapons, and whether the Confederacy is a rebellion or a new member state. (For context, Europa, the eldest Jovian, is 25 now, and teh Confederacy annoucned it's fomation 12 years ago)

### 2. The Outer Confederacy
A loose alliance of independent settlements, moons, and stations beyond the Asteroid Belt.
*   **Nature:** Born from necessity during the "Europa Incident," they are a decentralized democracy of captains and station administrators. Granted incredible research and advanced technology by the mysterious 'Jupiter' in exhcnage for granting her children asylum and a relatively normal life.
*   **Role:** They provide asylum and protection to the **Jovian Sisters**. In exchange, they receive advanced technology from Jupiter's network, allowing them to resist corporate and Republic predation. Should it come to a direct war with the Republic, the COnnfederacy would lose - but it would make e Republic *bleed*.
*   **Visuals:** An absolute melting pot of cultures. The COnfederacy is formed from 80 previously independant 'city states'. There is neither a rhyme nor a reason to its aesthetic.

### 3. The Jovian Sisters ("The Family")
 They are **not** a government; they are a family of genetically engineered post-humans.
*   **Nature:** The children of the scientist Jupiter. Each is unique, representing a different facet of transhuman evolution (Psychic, Cybernetic, Biological, etc).
*   **Relationship:** They live among the Confederacy. Some fight for it, some hide within it, and some just want to be left alone.
*   **Visuals:** Clean, medical, "Bio-punk," almost alien in their perfection. Bioluminescent accents and organic curves.

### 4. The Corporations
Technically Republic-chartered entities, the Megacorps have amassed independent power due to the Republic's bureaucratic inertia.
*   **Ira Corp:** The primary antagonist, specializing in "Acquisitions." They are hunting the Jovians.
*   **Haxaway Energy:** Controls the energy supplies of a good chunk of the Republic.
*   **Stance:** They arrogantly believe they are the true power, underestimating the dormant strength of the Republic, the cunning of the Jovians or the new might of the Confederacy.

## The Origin Lore: Jupiter's Legacy

**Jupiter** was/is a brilliant geneticist who unlocked the key to human psychic potential. Banned by the Republic, she went underground and detonated a "viral bomb" on **Ceres Station**.
*   **The Virus:** It didn't kill; it rewrote DNA. Some became psychics immediately; others became carriers, birthing children with psychic power. Within thirty years, Psychics made up about 0.2% of the human population - plenty enough when Humanity numbers almost 30 billion.
*   **Jupiters Children:** Years later, distinct "children" (the Jovians) emerged on different moons of Jupiter with unique genetic markers and powers. They were immediately hunted by the Republicand Corporations. Jovian moons that sheltered the children found themselves the recipients of Jupiters technologies and research, turning some (such as Callisto, a backwater) into rivals for inner-system locations (Callisto now has one of greatest hospitals in the system, for example)
*   **The Aftermath:** The refusal of the main colony on Europa to hand over the first "Sister", Europa herself, after Ira Corp kidnapped her sisters and almost initiated a new viral bomb (designed to kill) triggered the formation of the Confederacy.

## Cosmic Mysteries & Metaphysics

*   **Psychics:** Individuals with the active gene can manipulate forces like gravity, read emotions, or project energy.
*   **Psy-deaf:** A rare anomaly, people who are completely immune to psychic intrusion and resistant to telekinetic force.
*   **"That-between-gravity":** A cosmic horror element. Powerful psychics like **Europa** and **Metis** hear whispers from the void between celestial bodies. It implies that Jupiter's work may have breached a barrier to something... else. Or her work is to counter it.

## Key Story Arcs

### The Manhunt
The Republic is technically hunting Jupiter, but the file is buried in committee. The Corporations, however, are actively hunting her and her children.

### The Europa Incident
A rogue bioweapon threat on Europa. **Elara** (scientist) and **Himalia** (protector) uncovered a plot by a "lab for hire" to test a viral weapon on the Europan population, leading to a desperate race for a cure and a violent confrontation with drone armies. It was ended by the eldes sister, Europa, unleashing her full might and decimating a coporate compound. Rather than being arrested for the deaths (civilians were caught in the crossfire), Azure (the city in which this happened) announced she had done her best and sheltered her. Cunning and clever diplomats from Azure, including the Jovian Sinope, soon pulled in the other Europan colonies to form the basis of the Confederacy. Within two years, other settlements and moons joined, fearing the corporations doing something similar, and the ocnfederacy was born.

### The Ira Corp Abductions
Ira Corp has moved from corporate espionage to direct hostile action, abducting sisters like **Thebe**, **Pasiphae**, and **Metis** to black sites on Titan on Europa. This escalated the conflict from cold war to open skirmishes between the Jovians sisters and Ira Corp, resulting in the Europa Incident (which freed all the Jovians). The direct conflict continues, even as the Confederacy and Republic look elsewhere, resulting in a shadow war between the Sisters and the Corps.

## Technology and Robotics

### General Tech Level
Humanity has mastered the solar system but is bound by the speed of light.
*   **Propulsion:** High-efficiency fusion drives allow for travel between planets in weeks.
*   **Energy:** Fusion is abundant.

### Robotics & AI
*   **Drones:** Ubiquitous.
*   **Mechs:** Used for heavy labor and heavy combat.
*   **Artificial Intelligence:** True AGI is rare and heavily regulated. Most "AI" are advanced expert systems.

### Cybernetics vs. Bio-hacking
*   **Bio-hacking:** The Jovian specialty. Gene-editing to withstand radiation, breathe toxic air (Thebe), or enhance intelligence. Considered "elegant" by the Outer System.
*   **Cybernetics:** The Inner System/Corporate preference. Replacing limbs with steel, ocular implants, neural jacks. Considered "crude" but effective.
