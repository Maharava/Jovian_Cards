# Republic Faction File

## Overview
**The United Republic of Sol** (often just "The Republic") is the colossal, ancient, and terrifyingly bureaucratic government of humanity. It is not a monolith, but a sprawling, grinding machine comprising billions of souls. It is often described as "The Mother and Her Three Daughters."

*   **Population:** ~22 Billion
*   **Archetype:** Sleeping Giant / Economic / Defensive
*   **Motto:** "Order Through Consensus."
*   **Visual Style:** **Classical Sci-Fi.** Sleek, utilitarian white and grey aesthetics. Massive, pristine starships that look like flying cities. Endless rows of identical, uniformed troopers. The aesthetic of a civilization that has conquered nature but is drowning in paperwork.

## Structure: The Mother and Her Daughters

### The Mother: Earth
*   **Population:** 10+ Billion.
*   **Status:** The ancient heart. Earth is governed by nations, which unite into Regional Unions (like the European Union), which unite into the UN, which is the primary governing body of Earth and sends representatives to the Republic Senate. It is crowded, historical, and politically gridlocked.

### The First Daughter: Mars
*   **Status:** Terraformed. The only "Daughter" that is fully unified politically.
*   **Power:** Mars possesses enough industrial and political weight to occasionally rival Earth. It is the powerhouse of the Republic's heavy industry.

### The Second Daughter: Luna
*   **Status:** Not terraformed. Enclosed dome-cities.
*   **Role:** A massive transit hub and research center, acting as Earth's gateway to the stars.

### The Third Daughter: Venus
*   **Status:** Not terraformed. A network of floating orbital cities high in the atmosphere.
*   **Role:** High-tech manufacturing and luxury living for the elite who prefer to float above the acid clouds.

### The Void Settlements
*   **Mercury:** Orbital solar arrays and settlements.
*   **Martian Moons:** Surface and orbital cities.
*   **Deep Space:** Massive stations like 'Atlantis' (Pop: 500 Million).
*   **Political Power:** Despite their size, these settlements have roughly the same political power as a single nation on Earth.

## The Bureaucracy (The Real Power)
The Republic is defined by its paralysis. It fears dictatorship so intensely that it has designed a system where no single person can make a decision.

*   **The Chain of Command:** The **Republic Military** (Navy and Planetary) runs like a traditional force but is subservient to the **Civilian Defence Ministry**, which reports to the **Committee for Defence Affairs**, which reports to the **Committee for External and Internal Affairs**, which reports to the **Senate**.
*   **The Speed of Law:** "Shit's slow." Decisions take months. Military deployments take years to authorize.
*   **The Legal System:** A monument to humanity's desire to quantify everything. A court case regarding a border dispute might be heard 12 years after the dispute was settled by gunfire.

### The "Sleeping Giant"
Despite this, the Republic is **terrifying**. It possesses 90% of the human race's resources, ships, and soldiers.
*   **The Threat:** Should the Republic ever actually *finish* a committee meeting and authorize total war, they could render Earth uninhabitable in an hour. They simply haven't done so because the paperwork hasn't cleared.
*   **No "Special Agents":** There are no super-spies or "Auditors" who bend the rules. Everyone, from the Admiral to the private, is bound by the same suffocating red tape.

## Foreign Policy (Or Lack Thereof)

### The "Jovian Question"
The Republic cannot agree on what the Jovian Sisters *are*.
*   **Ministry of Health:** Classifies them as "Modified Humans" eligible for benefits (if they fill out Form 104-B).
*   **Ministry of Defence:** Classifies them as "biological weapons."
*   **Ministry of the Interior:** Classifies them as "Aliens."
*   **Result:** Policy is inconsistent, contradictory, and often frozen in debate.

### The Confederacy
The Republic does not recognize the Outer Confederacy as a sovereign nation.
*   **The Debate:** Bureaucrats are still arguing if the Confederacy is a "Secessionist Movement," a "Rebellion," or simply a "New Member State" that hasn't paid its dues.
*   **The Reality:** While they argue, the Confederacy effectively rules the Outer System.

### The Corporations
The Megacorps (Ira, Haxaway, etc.) are technically Republic-chartered entities.
*   **The Loophole:** The Corps have amassed incredible power simply because the Republic moves too slowly to stop them.
*   **The Danger:** Corporate CEOs often underestimate the Republic, viewing it as a dinosaur. They forget that if the Republic ever *did* decide to break corporate power, it would be unstoppable. The Corps survive only because the policy to destroy them would take decades to write.

## Strategic Doctrine
The Republic plays the long game. They don't need to be fast; they just need to be inevitable.

### Core Pillars:
1.  **Requisition (Energy Banking):** Representing the slow authorization process. By banking energy (waiting for paperwork), they unlock massive power.
2.  **Defensive Stance:** They hold the line. They are the immovable object.
3.  **Logistical Superiority:** When the supplies finally arrive, they arrive in endless quantities.

### Strengths:
*   Unbeatable late-game power.
*   Massive defensive stats.
*   Resource generation that outpaces any other faction.

### Weaknesses:
*   Extremely slow to start.
*   Vulnerable to agile, aggressive tactics before their "orders" arrive.
