# Jovian Sisters Faction File

## Overview
**The Jovian Sisters** (often called "The Family") are the genetically engineered children of **Jupiter**, the most brilliant geneticist to ever grace humanity. They are the first—and only—non-human sentient beings in the system. Though their baseline DNA is human, they were grown with radical genetic alterations that have matured into stable, functional post-human physiology—something regular humans can only approximate with crude surgery.

They are not a government. They are refugees, mercenaries, and celebrities living under the protection of the **Outer Confederacy**, a coalition of independent moon settlements. In exchange for asylum and privacy, the Sisters provide the Confederacy with advanced technology from Jupiter's network, allowing this young "Space Western" nation to stand toe-to-toe with the Republic.

While some Sisters work directly for the Confederacy military (like **Amalthea**) or local governments, most operate independently.

*   **Archetype:** Midrange / Synergy / Hero-Centric
*   **Motto:** "Evolution is our birthright."
*   **Visual Style:** **Bio-Punk.** Clean white medical aesthetics, bioluminescent blues and purples, organic curves, and high-tech visors. They stand in stark contrast to the rugged, industrial look of their Confederate allies.

## The "Sisters" (And Brothers)
The faction is led by the genetically engineered children of Jupiter. Each represents a unique facet of post-human evolution.

### 1. The Psychics (The Void-Touched)
Those who carry the active "Jupiter Gene," granting them varying degrees of telekinetic or telepathic power.
*   **Europa (The Eldest):** A powerful psychic burdened by leadership.
*   **Metis (The Empath):** Can heal wounds by manipulating biological energy but feels the pain of others.
*   **Lysithea (The Glitch):** A chaotic psychic whose presence disrupts technology.

### 2. The Fighters (The Protectors)
Often "Psy-deaf" (immune to psychic influence), these siblings rely on physical prowess and advanced weaponry.
*   **Ganymede (The Pugilist):** A brawler who loves a fight.
*   **Himalia (The Shield):** A massive, heavily armored protector.
*   **Callisto (The Survivor):** A street-smart fighter who gets stronger as she takes damage.

### 3. The Technicians (The Builders)
Those who interface with machines or enhance their bodies with cybernetics.
*   **Elara (The Scientist):** The researcher and strategist.
*   **Io (The Gremlin):** A drone operator and hacker.
*   **Carpo (The Specialist):** A pacifist gadgeteer who buffs her allies.

## Strategic Doctrine
The Jovian playstyle focuses on **Unit Quality** and **Synergy**. Unlike the Megacorp swarm, Jovian units are individually strong and become significantly more powerful when working together.

### Core Pillars:
1.  **Synergy:** Many units buff allies (Support, Rally) or rely on board presence.
2.  **Sustain:** High access to **Healing** and **Shields** (Guard) allows units to survive multiple turns and accrue value.
3.  **Versatility:** Access to a wide toolkit—Stuns (Control), Rushes (Aggro), and Card Draw (Value).

### Strengths:
*   High-value units that are hard to remove.
*   Strong board control tools (Stun, Disarm).
*   Excellent card draw and resource generation.

### Weaknesses:
*   Units are expensive; tempo loss can be fatal.
*   Vulnerable to "hard removal" (destroy effects) since they invest heavily in single units.
