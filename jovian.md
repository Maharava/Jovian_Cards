# Jovian Family
The Jovian Sisters are the genertically-engineered children of Jupiter, the most brilliant genetecist to ever grace humanity. The first - and only - non-human sentient beings in the system, the Jovians are of intense interest. Though their baseline DNA is human, they were grown and born with genetic alterations and have matured into adulthood with no ill effects - regular humans cannot develop with genetic changes, and must get them later in life.
The sister - despite have two boys, they're called the sisters - are each named after a moon of Jupiter. Though they know where their mother is - the most wanted criminal in the system - they won't give her up, and live amongst the free settlements and new Outer Confederacy amongst the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. So long as these settlements and new nation protect the Sisters and grant them some privacy, they are rewarded with incredible research and technology by Jupiter. Indeed, the initial refusal of the main colony on Europa to hand Europa Jovia over to the Republic triggered the formation of the confederacy, as Jupiter and her network delivered vast resources and new technologies to the moon, making it strong enough to stare down a Republic battleship.


*   **Archetype:**  Diverse abilities.
*   **Motto:** "Evolution is our birthright."
*   **Visual Style:** Clean white medical aesthetic, bioluminescent blues and purples, organic curves, high-tech visors, and distinct character designs for each "Sister."

## The "Sisters" (And Brothers)
The faction is led by the genetically engineered children of Jupiter. Each represents a unique facet of post-human evolution.

### 1. The Psychics (The Void-Touched)
Those who carry the active "Jupiter Gene," granting them varying degrees of telekinetic or telepathic power.
*   **Europa (The Eldest):** A powerful psychic burdened by leadership.
*   **Metis (The Empath):** Can heal wounds by manipulating biological energy but feels the pain of others.
*   **Lysithea (The Glitch):** A chaotic psychic whose presence disrupts technology.

### 2. The Fighters (The Protectors)
Often "Psy-deaf" (immune to psychic influence), these siblings rely on physical prowess and advanced weaponry.
*   **Ganymede (The Pugilist):** A brawler who loves a fight.
*   **Himalia (The Shield):** A massive, heavily armored protector.
*   **Callisto (The Survivor):** A street-smart fighter who gets stronger as she takes damage.

### 3. The Technicians (The Builders)
Those who interface with machines or enhance their bodies with cybernetics.
*   **Elara (The Scientist):** The researcher and strategist.
*   **Io (The Gremlin):** A drone operator and hacker.
*   **Carpo (The Specialist):** A pacifist gadgeteer who buffs her allies.

## Strategic Doctrine
The Jovian playstyle focuses on **Unit Quality** and **Synergy**. Unlike the Megacorp swarm, Jovian units are individually strong and become significantly more powerful when working together.

### Core Pillars:
1.  **Synergy:** Many units buff allies (Support, Rally) or rely on board presence.
2.  **Sustain:** High access to **Healing** and **Shields** (Guard) allows units to survive multiple turns and accrue value.
3.  **Versatility:** Access to a wide toolkit—Stuns (Control), Rushes (Aggro), and Card Draw (Value).

### Strengths:
*   High-value units that are hard to remove.
*   Strong board control tools (Stun, Disarm).
*   Excellent card draw and resource generation.

### Weaknesses:
*   Units are expensive; tempo loss can be fatal.
*   Vulnerable to "hard removal" (destroy effects) since they invest heavily in single units.
