NOTES
Jovian refers to Jupiter (the scientist) and her children. It RARELY refers to the Jovian system of Jupiter (the planet) and its moons.
The Jovians are often called the Jovian Sisters, despite several males in the family. This is due to the majority being female and the males being nonbinary/femboys.

# World of Jovian Cards: A Setting Guide

## The Solar System
The game takes place entirely within our Solar System. Humanity has colonized the inner planets, the Asteroid Belt, and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. There is **no Faster-Than-Light (FTL)** travel; travel between planets takes weeks or months, relying on efficient fusion drives and orbital mechanics.

This isolation has led to a fractured civilization. Earth and the Inner System are old, crowded, and bureaucratic. The Outer System (Jupiter, Saturn) is the frontier—dangerous, independent, and technologically divergent.

## Major Powers & Factions

### 1. The Human Republic
The nominal government of humanity, centered on Earth.
*   **Nature:** Massive, bureaucratic, and largely ineffectual in the Outer System.
*   **Influence:** While they claim jurisdiction over the entire system, their actual power wanes significantly past the Asteroid Belt.
*   **Stance:** They view the "Jovian" genetic modifications as a threat to human stability and maintain an active (though often incompetent) manhunt for the geneticist known as Jupiter.

### 2. The Jovian Confederation (The "Family")
Not a formal nation-state, but a loose alliance of the moons of Jupiter (Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, etc.), united by their protection of Jupiter's children.
*   **Nature:** Technocratic, independent, and wealthy. They embraced the "children" of Jupiter and the advanced genetic/bio-hacking technology they brought.
*   **Economy:** Booming due to patents on human engineering and biological hacking derived from Jupiter's research.
*   **The Sisters:** Jupiter's genetically engineered children operate independantly. Some work for a nation-state or corporation, others just live their lives. All are of interest to greater humanity, effectively minor celebrities.

### 3. The Corporations
In the vacuum of effective Republic governance, mega-corporations wield state-like power.
*   **Ira Corp:** A massive, shadowy conglomerate and a primary antagonist. They specialize in "Acquisitions"—stealing technology, ideas, and people. They are ruthlessly hunting the Jovian sisters to reverse-engineer their genetics.
*   **Rogue Labs:** Independent "labs for hire" that operate in the lawless zones, developing banned tech like bioweapons (as seen in the *Europa Incident*).

## The Origin Lore: Jupiter's Legacy

**Jupiter** was a brilliant geneticist who unlocked the key to human psychic potential. Banned by the Republic, she went underground and detonated a "viral bomb" on **Ceres Station**.
*   **The Virus:** It didn't kill; it rewrote DNA. Some became psychics immediately; others became carriers, birthing children with psychic power. Within thirty years, Psychics made up about 0.2% of the human population - plenty enough when Humanity numbers almost 100 billion.
*   **Jupiters Children:** Years later, distinct "children" (the Jovians) emerged on different moons of Jupiter with unique genetic markers and powers. They were immediately hunted by the Republic. Jovian moons that sheltered the children found themselves the recipients of Jupiters technologies and research, turning some (such as Callisto, a backwater) into rivals for inner-system locations (Callisto now has one of greatest hospitals in the system, for example)
*   **The Aftermath:** The Jovian moons granted asylum to these children. In return, the children helped elevate these colonies into powers capable of rivaling Earth.

## Cosmic Mysteries & Metaphysics

*   **Psychics:** Individuals with the active gene can manipulate forces like gravity, read emotions, or project energy.
*   **Psy-deaf:** A rare anomaly, people who are completely immune to psychic intrusion and resistant to telekinetic force.
*   **"That-between-gravity":** A cosmic horror element. Powerful psychics like **Europa** and **Metis** hear whispers from the void between celestial bodies. It implies that Jupiter's work may have breached a barrier to something... else.

## Key Story Arcs

### The Manhunt
The Republic is still hunting Jupiter. The Jovians know where she is, but maintain a wall of silence. Rumors suggest she is mutating herself into a higher life form.

### The Europa Incident
A rogue bioweapon threat on Europa. **Elara** (scientist) and **Himalia** (protector) uncovered a plot by a "lab for hire" to test a viral weapon on the Europan population, leading to a desperate race for a cure and a violent confrontation with drone armies.

### The Ira Corp Abductions
Ira Corp has moved from corporate espionage to direct hostile action, abducting sisters like **Thebe**, **Pasiphae**, and **Metis** to black sites on Titan. This has escalated the conflict from cold war to open skirmishes between the Jovians sisters and Ira Corp (the sisters were rescued)

## The Jovians (The Sisters & Brothers)
*   **Europa:** The Eldest. Powerful psychic, burdened by leadership and cosmic whispers.
*   **Ganymede:** The Fighter. "Psy-deaf" pugilist, loves a fight, deeply loyal.
*   **Elara:** The Scientist. Gentle, nature-loving researcher of the group.
*   **Himalia:** The Shield. Massive, shy, "Psy-deaf" tank who protects the family.
*   **Io:** The Tech-Gremlin. Femboy hacker and drone operator.
*   **Leda:** The Scavenger. Stealthy kleptomaniac who finds things.
*   **Praxidike:** The Trickster. Acrobatic, charming, and cunning.
*   **Metis:** The Empath. Cursed to feel everyone's anxiety; hears the voices.
*   **Amalthea:** The Soldier. Disciplined support technician, reliable and professional.
*   **Callisto:** The Brawler. Street-smart fighter from the lower habs, fights dirty to survive.
*   **Carpo:** The Specialist. Tech-obsessed pacifist, solves problems with gadgets rather than guns.
*   **Pasiphae:** The Pilot. Quiet gamer girl who dominates the battlefield in her mech.
*   **Sinope:** The Survivor. Mean-spirited trickster who relies on sharp instincts and simple tools.
*   **Thebe:** The Transhumanist. Obsessed with self-modification, bio-hacking her body for perfection.

## Technology and Robotics

### General Tech Level
Humanity has mastered the solar system but is bound by the speed of light.
*   **Propulsion:** High-efficiency fusion drives allow for travel between planets in weeks. Gravity manipulation is theoretically possible (via psychics) but technologically rudimentary and expensive (artificial gravity on stations is spin-based or magnetic plating).
*   **Energy:** Fusion is abundant, powering everything from cities to personal armor.

### Robotics & AI
*   **Drones:** Ubiquitous in combat and industry. Most are "dumb" machines controlled by simple algorithms or human operators (like Io).
*   **Mechs:** Used for heavy labor and heavy combat. Pilots like Pasiphae interface directly with these machines for enhanced reaction times.
*   **Artificial Intelligence:** True AGI is rare and heavily regulated (or lost). Most "AI" are advanced expert systems. Ancient "Pre-Republic" AI cores are highly sought-after artifacts, rumored to possess banned capabilities.

### Cybernetics vs. Bio-hacking
*   **Bio-hacking:** The Jovian specialty. Gene-editing to withstand radiation, breathe toxic air (Thebe), or enhance intelligence. Considered "elegant" by the Outer System.
*   **Cybernetics:** The Inner System/Corporate preference. Replacing limbs with steel, ocular implants, neural jacks. Considered "crude" but effective.
