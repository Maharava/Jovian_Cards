# Megacorp Faction File

## Overview
**The Megacorps** represent the raw industrial and capitalist might of the billionaire class. Outside of the Republic and new Confederacy, they are the law—but law comes with a cost.

While the Republic claims jurisdiction, **Ira Corp** and its subsidiaries enforce it—strictly for profit. They view the Jovian bio-hackers not as people, but as intellectual property theft waiting to be "reacquired." Other megacorps, such as **Solarin Industries**, focus their efforts on harvesting the near-endless supplies and resources of the system, while **Haxaway** holds a monopoly on the system's Dyson Swarm and fusion matter facilities, supplying a third of the system's fuel and energy needs on their own.

*   **Archetype:** Industrial Swarm / Aggro / Resource Denial
*   **Visual Style:** Sleek matte-black composites, neon orange warning lights, faceless security helmets, swarms of utilitarian drones.

## Major Corporations

### 1. Ira Corp ("The Hand")
The primary antagonist force in the sector. Ira Corp specializes in "Hostile Acquisitions"—a euphemism for military raids to secure technology, personnel, and resources. They are currently hunting the Jovian Sisters to reverse-engineer the genetic modifications that make them unique.
*   **Specialty:** Cybernetics, Drones, Private Military Contracting.
*   **Leader:** Director Kaelen Vance (a brain in a jar, though few know this).

### 2. Solarin Industries
A subsidiary focusing on mining and heavy infrastructure. Their "Mining Drones" are easily repurposed into shrapnel bombs.
*   **Specialty:** Ore extraction, automated defenses, orbital construction.

### 3. Omni-Medical Solutions
The "friendly face" of corporate dominance. They provide the stims that keep workers awake for 20-hour shifts and the cybernetics that replace limbs lost in "workplace accidents."
*   **Specialty:** Combat drugs, cybernetic prosthetics, biological containment.

## Strategic Doctrine
The Megacorp playstyle is defined by **expendability** and **momentum**. They do not value individual units; they value the output of the aggregate.

### Core Pillars:
1.  **Swarm Tactics:** Flooding the board with cheap, low-stat units (Drones, Security Bots) that overwhelm single-target removal.
2.  **Sacrifice ("Downsizing"):** Destroying their own weak units to trigger powerful effects (drawing cards, dealing damage, gaining energy).
3.  **Debuffs:** Instead of killing strong enemies outright, they cripple them with "Hack" or "Weak" status effects, rendering them useless but taking up board space.

### Strengths:
*   Fast board development.
*   High burst damage if the swarm is ignored.
*   Strong resource generation.

### Weaknesses:
*   Individual units are weak and die to AoE.
*   Runs out of "gas" (cards in hand) quickly if the game drags on.
*   Struggles against heavy armor/healing.
