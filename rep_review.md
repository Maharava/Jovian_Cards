# Republic Faction Card Review

This document contains a review of the Republic faction cards as presented in `republic.md`. The analysis focuses on lore consistency, mechanical identity, and overall balance.

## General Observations

The Republic faction is brilliantly designed from a lore and flavor perspective. The central theme of a slow, bureaucratic but ultimately unstoppable defensive powerhouse is captured perfectly by the **Requisition** mechanic and the high-health `Guard` units. The flavor text and card names consistently reinforce this identity.

The main areas for review are in the **balance of stats and costs**. Several cards, particularly at their T2 and T3 versions, offer a level of value that may be too high for their cost, potentially making them auto-includes and reducing deck diversity. Conversely, a few cards have awkward tier progressions, making their intermediate versions feel underpowered.

## Key Issues & Recommendations

### Card-Specific Balance Concerns

#### **COMMON UNITS**

*   **James Park (Logistics)**
    *   **Issue:** The T3 version, a 3-cost 2/6 with "Turn Start: Draw 1," is excessively powerful. A unit that replaces itself every turn is a high-value engine, and at 3 cost with 6 health, it's very difficult for many factions to remove in the early game.
    *   **Recommendation:** Increase the cost of the T3 version to 4, or change the ability to a one-time effect, like "OnPlay: Draw 1" or "Requisition 5: Draw 1".

*   **Lira Chen (Psionic)**
    *   **Issue:** The tier progression is awkward. The T2 version (3 Cost, 2/3) is significantly weaker than other 3-cost units and feels like a poor value proposition compared to the T1 (2 Cost, 2/2).
    *   **Recommendation:** Improve the T2's stats to be more in line with its cost, perhaps making it a 3/3 or 2/4. This would create a smoother power curve up to the T3 version.

*   **Advocate Cross (Control)**
    *   **Issue:** Similar to Lira Chen, the T2 version (3 Cost, 1/3) is very weak for its cost. The jump in power to the T3 (3-cost 2/4 with an additional ability) is jarring.
    *   **Recommendation:** Buff the T2's stats (e.g., to 2/3) or lower its cost to 2 to make it a viable step in the upgrade path.

#### **UNCOMMON UNITS**

*   **Councilor Zhang (Bureaucrat)**
    *   **Issue:** The T3 version (4 Cost, 0/8, Requisition 3: Draw 2, Turn Start: Gain 1 Energy) is a phenomenal economic engine. A 4-cost unit that provides both card advantage and energy ramp is potentially too strong, especially with 8 health making it hard to remove.
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider increasing the Requisition cost for the draw effect (e.g., Requisition 4 or 5) or removing the "Turn Start: Gain 1 Energy" ability to focus the card on its card-draw identity.

*   **Marcus Reeves (Squad Leader)**
    *   **Issue:** The power jump from T1 (Rally 1 random) to T2 (Rally 1 all) is massive for a card that costs the same (3 energy). It makes the T1 version feel like a placeholder.
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider increasing the T2's cost to 4, or slightly nerfing its ability (e.g., "Rally 1 to two other random allies").

#### **RARE UNITS**

*   **Commander Drake (Elite Officer)**
    *   **Issue:** The T1 card has a potentially confusing ability: "OnPlay: Deal 2 damage to the enemy Commander. Requisition 5: deal 2 damage to the enemy Commander." Does this mean it can trigger twice? The T3 version (5 cost 6/5 with Rush) is an incredibly powerful finisher, perhaps too efficient.
    *   **Recommendation:** Clarify the T1 ability text. For the T3, consider reducing its stats slightly (e.g., to 5/5 or 6/4) to balance its high-impact keywords.

*   **Senator Okoye (Political Power)**
    *   **Issue:** A permanent, board-wide +1/+1 buff (`Requisition 5: All other Republic units gain +1/+1 permanently`) is extremely powerful and can quickly snowball a game. Given the defensive nature of the Republic, this can create an insurmountable board state.
    *   **Recommendation:** Change the buff to be temporary ("...until the start of your next turn") or increase the Requisition cost significantly (e.g., Requisition 7 or 8).

*   **Commander Voss (Premium Defense)**
    *   **Issue:** The stats on this unit are far above the curve. A 5-cost 5/10 with `Guard` and `Shield` is nearly impossible for many decks to deal with. It shuts down entire strategies single-handedly.
    *   **Recommendation:** Reduce the health significantly. A 5/8 or even 4/7 with `Guard` and `Shield` would still be a premier defensive unit without being oppressive.

### Tactic Balance

*   **Strategic Reserve (1 cost, Draw 2)**
    *   **Issue:** This is the most significant balance concern among the tactics. Drawing 2 cards for 1 energy is extraordinarily efficient and would be an automatic inclusion in every single Republic deck, limiting player choice.
    *   **Recommendation:** **Increase the cost to 3.** This is a standard cost for this powerful effect in many card games.

*   **Authorization Code Alpha (2 cost, All allies +1/+1)**
    *   **Issue:** A permanent board-wide buff for only 2 energy is very powerful, especially when combined with the Republic's ability to create token units.
    *   **Recommendation:** Increase the cost to 3 or 4, or make the buff temporary.

### Lore & Text Inconsistencies

The lore is generally excellent and consistent. However, a few minor typos and inconsistencies were noted:

*   **Elvie Webb:** The lore text for "Elvie Webb (Biological - Psionic)" refers to the character as "Marcus Webb".
*   **Admiral Chen:** The card is named "Admiral Chen" with the T1 lore mentioning "Sorita Chen," but the lore table at the bottom lists the T1 as "David Chen." The gender of the character is inconsistent.

## Conclusion

The Republic is a well-realized faction with a strong identity. The core mechanics are sound and flavorful. The primary need is a balance pass to tone down the efficiency of a few key engine cards (James Park T3, Councilor Zhang T3), powerful finishers (Commander Drake T3), and defensive outliers (Commander Voss). Additionally, the cost of the `Strategic Reserve` tactic should be addressed to ensure healthy deck-building variety.
